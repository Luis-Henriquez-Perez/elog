* What is elog
elog is a simple logging library for elisp. It is extended from [[https://github.com/sigma/logito][logito]]

* How to use elog
1. require the file
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'elog)
   #+END_SRC

2. use `elog/open-log' macro to generate your own logging function.
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (elog/open-log TYPE IDENT &rest init-args)
   #+END_SRC

   This macro generate two functions: the `elog/IDENT-log' for logging job and the `elog/IDENT-close-log' for cleanning job.

   `TYPE' specify which kind of elog-object is used. Now, elog support three types of elog-object:

   + message :: use `message' function to do the logging job.

   + buffer :: log item will be recoreded in a specify buffer.

   + file :: log item will be recoreded in a specify buffer.
             
   `init-args' is used to initialize the elog-object.
   
   + :level :: specify the logging level. The default value is `elog-info'

   + :fmt :: specify the logging format string. There are some %-sequences has a special meaning in it.
             %I means the `IDENT' argument
             %T means current time 
             %L means level
             %M measn message

   + :buffer :: It only used when generate buffer type logging functions. It specify which buffer is used to record the logging item.

   + :file :: It only used when generate file type logging functions. It specify which file is used to record the logging item.

3. use `elog/IDENT-log' function to do the logging job.
   
   (elog/IDENT-log LEVEL FORMAT-STRING &rest OBJECTS)

4. use `elog/IDENT-close-log' function to do the cleanning job if you wish.

   (elog/IDENT-close-log)

* How to extend elog
Elog is extensible. You just need to define a new subclass of elog-object  three method:

+ elog/should-log-p :: this function is used to check if the log item should be recored

+ elog/insert-log :: this function is used to do the actual logging job

+ elog/close-log :: this function is used to do the cleanning job.
